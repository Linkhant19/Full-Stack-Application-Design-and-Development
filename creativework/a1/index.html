            <p>
                Hey, I am Lin!
                <br>
                I am an aspiring software engineer studying Computer Science and Psychology at Boston University. 
                I was born in a small town called Meiktila in the middle of Myanmar. 
                In my free time, I like to do escape rooms, play board games, or play volleyball!
